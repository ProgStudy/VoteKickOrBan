--------------------------------------------

#### Other information:
- voting can only be started after the completion of the previous vote
- when voting starts, all players create a BossBar, including those players who connected to the server during voting
- you can vote by answering (Yes) or (No), and at the end of the vote the number of voters (Yes) and (No) is read, due to this, the action (kick or ban) is triggered or vice versa the player will remain on the server
- stop the vote can only be the one who launched it
- when a player disconnects from the server, voting automatically stops (Iâ€™m still thinking about it, I want to remove it later)
- this plugin uses Russian by default
